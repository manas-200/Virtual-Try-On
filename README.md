Step-1:Create a project folder

    example:C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\image_blend_project
         Inside this folder, It should  have:
          image_blend.py ← the Python script I provided
           human.jpg ← your person image
            cloth.jpg ← your clothing image
         Put both images inside the same folder as the script.

Step-2:Open Command Prompt inside the folder

      Navigate to the folder:: cd C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\image_blend_project
      then verify with::  dir

Step-3:Install required Python packages

      Run this in the terminal (inside the folder):  pip install google-genai pillow
      google-genai → Google API library     
      pillow → to display images
      
Step-4:Create the Python script (image_blend.py) with the help of any text editor like Notepad/VS code etc ,then run it .

NOTE:In this same directory another two file should have :
    human.jpg → a person
    cloth.jpg → a shirt/dress/clothing item
  Then save and run.

NOTE:::In this code Prompt play the imprtant role so giving better prompt  helps to get  better result.
